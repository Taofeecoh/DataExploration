# DataExploration

For this SQL project, I brought in partially cleaned data from Excel to conduct exploratory analysis. 
This project is part of a larger Customer Analysis project, which requires gathering data from various database tables and merging them into a single dataset. 
The use of a temporary table was a noteworthy aspect of the project, as it was utilized after performing JOIN operations.

Please note that this project is still a work in progress, and there are plans to make further improvements and changes in the. 
Thank you!
